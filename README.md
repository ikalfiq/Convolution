# Convolution
Very basic convolution filter on a test image. Program done in Python

Convolution filters are used to compress images while still preserving reasonable amount of details from the original image. This is very useful to reduce computate intensity when running images through machine learning algorithms like neural networks. There are definitely libraries out there with far better algorithms and features than mine but this is purely an experimental endeavour for learning purposes and familiarisation with Github.

The image above shows 3 different phases (from left to right):

Original color image, grayscale image for easier processing, convolution filter applied to grayscale image. The 3 images have the same size for aesthetic purposes. The convoluted image is in fact, supposed to be slightly smaller than the other 2.
