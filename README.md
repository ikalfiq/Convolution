# Convolution
Very basic convolution filter on a test image. Program done in Python and C++. They are identical implementations just for practice purposes.

Convolution filters are used to compress images while still preserving reasonable amount of details from the original image. This is very useful to reduce compute intensity when running images through machine learning algorithms like neural networks. There are definitely libraries out there with far better algorithms and features than mine but this is purely an experimental endeavour for learning purposes and familiarisation with Github.

Usage guide:
	Presently, utility of this program is very basic and limited so the user just has to run the program.

Points of improvement:
1) Allow users to customize to their specific needs 
	- User's choice of image 
	- User's choice of filter parameters
	- Padding option to maintain original size of image?

2) Include popular filters as presets (like Gaussian filter)

Disclaimer: May or may not continue working on this repository. Depends on how practical it is...
